## Powered by Deloitte Romania - Cyber Risk Advisory Team

Hello,

Welcome to the Git corresponding to the hands on challenge corresponding to the blog post ["Deserialization vulnerabilities: root cause and importance"](https://www2.deloitte.com/ro/en/pages/risk/cybersecurity/decoder/deserialization-vulnerabilities-root-cause-importance.html?nc=42).
<br/>

The contents of this repository is focuesd on introducing you to how Java Deserialization exploits work by helping you setup a vulnerable Java Web Application in an isolated local docker environment. The challenge consists of identifying and successfully exploiting the Java Deserialization vulnerability in order to obtain Remote Code Execution on the target, and, if you like CTFs, getting the flag.
